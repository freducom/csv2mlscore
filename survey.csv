\"Vaadin 8 Migration & HTML / Web Components / Polymer (just give me Java, please\\\!)\",\"� Our primary reason for using Vaadin is because we're Java developers and do not want to have to deal with HTML. Yet when I look at the upcoming releases all I see is WebComponents & Polymer, using HTML. While I read my way into what it is and how we will be able to use them I imagine quite a lot of users are rather confused by the HTML, thinking: \"\"Isn't Vaadin supposed to be a Java Framework?\"\". I, too, don't quite understand why you advertise your upcoming products with HTML-examples, the upcoming Board component not even coming with a Java API in its first release (????). � We are currently struggling to migrate our project to Vaadin 8. Since we want to continue developing \"\"on top of it\"\" migrating with compatibility packages doesn't really make sense, thus we're left with a load of work to do that came \"\"out of nowhere\"\". While I personally am really happy with the Java 8 friendly changes I know that our management is not, the migration is rather costly. I hope that future major releases become less difficult to migrate to, else we might start looking for alternatives :(\"

Dealing with locks to UI interface from background threads is a pain and easily can lead to deadlocks which painful to overcome. Hard to detect concurrency issues to UI where a UI lock was not correctly applied  (UI corruption occurs and that's it) Internet Explorer 8+ terribly slow with Grids (had to cull all hidden columns and right a custom unhiding just to make the performance acceptable) V8 vaadin is difficult to migrate to - we can't use beans (our domain data is dynamically generated by server) so move from Property is a nusance. Uncaught exceptions can sometimes be silently ignore with just a session disconnection making debugging difficult Vaadin Spring is not supported well enough - difficult to get working first time.,\"Allow the vaadin components to self manage concurrency access through an auto or manual UI locking at component level ( internally they can buffer the UI updates and either submit the updates periodically, full buffer or developer can explicitly call UI.sync() call of some sort.  Perhaps contract out UI component development to increase the number of Vaadin UI components. ZK (your rival) has an extensive array of useful component that make their product quite attractive - more powerful grids (grouped data model, pagination), integrate query effects, masked fields, reporting wrapper, google maps wrapper - list is almost endless. I understand third party libraries are available but support and maintain ability is important to businesses when deciding on components - the components we chose son time ago have now stopped us from easily upgrading to vaadin 8.

\"Core components quality. We occasionally come across bugs or missing functionality and we spend a lot of time fixing stuff ourselves.  For example,  -inline editing in grid has bugs (we already reported them) -there is no official container with lazy loading support. LazyEntityContainer and LazyQueryContainer are the best choices out there but needed fixes. -google maps add on is based on a legacy GWT library that uses an old API which does not support for example Chinese version of the maps. It also had bugs. -vaadin spreadsheet has a lot of bugs and would not even load some excel files at all (without crashing) - the constructor just never returns.  These are just some issues that we came across. There were more.\",It would be much better to fix issues faster or make components more stable instead of just adding almost-working new components.
\"(1) I use Vaadin mainly because I can code in Java and don't have to master web technologies such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Even though this is the case, such web technologies always help to build great looking web applications. So, one challenge is to wrap any web technology with Java API so that I can use it as part of Vaadin development. (Of course, Vaadin provides enough technology for this but it is not totally seamless for someone who doesn't want to touch CSS and JavaScript).  (2) Mobile support\",\"(1) Wrapper API to use any Web Component as a Vaadin Framework Component. I hope that, in the future, all Vaadin Framework components will have its underlying implementation using Vaadin Elements components and it will be trivial to wrap any Vaadin Element to use it as Vaadin Framework component. Currently, I feel that Elements are developed totally independently and it looks like duplication of work.  (2) Mobile support of Vaadin is still not up to the mark. I licensed the Touchkit but couldn't deliver a Mobile app due to its rough edges and theme issues (Valo is not supported). Also, there are issues on touch devices that prevent developers from developing Vaadin applications on touch devices - for example, a Vaadin Window is not draggable on a touch device). Finally, I had to use Codenameone to deliver a mobile application instead of Vaadin.\"

We have too much work and not enough people to do it. However we already have a meeting lined up with a few people from Vaadin next week to discuss this very thing. :) (And have worked with yourselves on a prior project),\"After using Vaadin for five years my challenges are not technical, but political. The corporate standard is Angular, so trying to convince upper management to switch to Vaadin is a daily struggle.  \",
With this long survey.,Liferay 7 compatibility.,Liferay 7 compatibility.\"1)  Technology migration - V7 to V8 migration took months including pre-release preparations.  Discontinuation of TouchKit took weeks from re-design to debug and entails some significant compromises.  The mobile experience is far from ideal.  However new APIs and behaviours of V8 are mostly very welcome.  The migration is done now, but it took an estimated 5-10% of total project development time to achieve.  Quite a lot.  I wonder what issues to expect around Java 9, Tomcat 9, Vaadin plans?  For example, if someone could have told me 2 or 3 years ago to start thinking of a data model without SQLContainers, I might not have had hundreds of them to replace in the V8 migration.  What traps am I building now that will burden me during the next great migration?  2)  Thanks to Vaadin's good work and V8 migration complete, the biggest struggles are keeping up with the business logic.  That is how it should be.  The framework does a lot of heavy lifting and provides an excellent user experience.  People have taken pictures of my UIs to contrast with other products not fortunate enough to use Vaadin.\",\"Critical comments below need to be taken in context:  I am very happy with Vaadin overall and am indebted to the hard work that the team does every day.  1)  I am somewhat concerned about the overall framework strategy.  It appears from here (half way around the planet in western Canada) that Vaadin spends a lot of time on projects that are somewhat tangential - Designer, Spreadsheet, possibly TreeGrid, although I might change my tune on that last one when I start using it.  I place more value on vigorous evolution of small components.  For example, there is so much that could be done with ComboBox.  Even basic quality - after many months of the V7 version of ComboBox losing selections on blur, it was finally fixed.  Now with V8, ComboBox<T> again loses its selection on blur...  How about a selection component that supports autocomplete against likely matches?  2)  I would value more priority on mobile component development.  Everyone uses a mobile phone.  A suite of mobile optimized components would be welcome.  3)  Pay as much attention to performance as possible.  Grid rendering, for example has slowed by a factor of 2 or 3 in Vaadin 8.  A recovery to V7 speeds (or better) would be appreciated.  Henri Sara made a quick (and huge) improvement a couple releases ago to Grid, but there is room for improvement in browser rendering speed.  Chrome's developer pages provide lots of advice about performance problems, but it would take a framework expert to understand and deal with them.  4)  I wonder if there is any technical possibility to reduce reliance on compiled sass theme elements?  Using un-checked string variables referring to css elements is tedious and error prone.  In an ideal world there would be java-based APIs that might go something like this:   textField.setBackgroundColor(\"\"#ff4534\"\"); with nothing in a sass file.  This would be helpful for a handful of standard settings of text and colorings, while the more obscure ones might still use the sass file.  5)  I would appreciate more blogs that explain what Vaadin is expecting to accomplish with various developments.  For example Binder.  It's easy enough to see what Binder does.  But often the structure of components on the UI may depend on business logic, the actions of local and remote users and the data itself.  Binder seems like a hard-coded short circuit between the UI and a database table.  Is it designed for CRUD developers where user forms and database tables have a 1:1 relationship?  Or could those of us with dynamic structures still benefit from it?  I have not been able to justify the additional design cost of overlaying Binder onto an existing project, therefore I lost binder-based validation and access to other binder features in the migration to V8.  The key point is that we get told what a feature is, without understanding its target use cases, and perhaps where not to expect to make use of it.  It would nice to hear more of the strategy for using a component along with tutorial-oriented material.  I suppose I've already written more than most humans would read...  Thanks for all the hard work.\"

In particular, it was incredibly easy to create tables (grids) with a data model loaded on demand (by implementing a simple interface, in Vaadin, for me, is much more complex). In ZK is very convenient implement one or more row renderers for the grid. I also tried Primefaces, even here implementing the lazy load of data is very simple, a lot of components (grids, tables etc ...) are natively suited for mobile (they auto reduce the columns and they turn to be readable). Primefaces in Netbeans has a intellisense between page, code and css that helps a lot to produce quickly (really great). In Vaadin the designer for eclipse is heavy and it's hard to figure out how to leverage it so it's quick, if you edit the xml code that describes the web form you do not have helo or suggestion (you have to remember all the syntax). In Netbeans you have not even implemented the Designer, considering that it is the most similar IDE to the most professional IntelliJ is a shame. Finally, both ZK and Primefaces (in particular) have a set of components that belong to the core of the framework, while in Vaadin there are many plug-ins that do not know paternity, stability and future life.\"

I think the transition from 7 to 8 is a bit more of a forklift than I would have liked. I think you should have published the v8 APIs in com.vaadin.v8 and left the v7 APIs in com.vaadin.ui. That way you could have used the same pattern for v9 and beyond.

\"Documentation -- there is a gap between low-level API docs and the introductory docs (such as the Book of Vaadin) that significantly impacts productivity. For example, (more) docs on common design patterns, best practices, building ones own server-side components, as well as on Vaadin internals, such as how the request/response loop works, or how to properly do responsive layout, would make it much easier to properly use Vaadin.  Community (Forum) -- Most of our questions go unanswered, so we have to look elsewhere. Since Vaadin does not have a huge userbase, this often means that no answer can be found.  Limited component set -- while the existing component set is good, it isn't adequate for modern app development. In our business-facing app, we've had to do more custom component development than we'd really like to, and our needs are by no means \"\"special\"\".  Support -- sometimes, we have specific, narrow questions that experts at Vaadin almost certainly already have answers to.

Demo Source Code -- The source code is already available on github and of course useful, but it would be much more useful if there was some documentation describing the design and architecture of the demo apps.

Support -- consider offering \"\"Technical Support Incidents\"\" at a reasonable cost (say 100-300 �) that will allow us to ask you specific technical questions that your framework experts can work on for a short while. Note that this is not for custom development, only for technical support. Therefore, it should be more lightweight than bespoke development or engineering services.\"

I believe that any user before having a new item generated (from typing its name) would like to confirm before creating a new database record.

I reported the issue (https://vaadin.com/forum/#\\\!/thread/15354941/15354940) and spent time to isolate the bug on an example provided in Vaadin tutorial. Got no single answer.

Honestly I can't make available a spreadsheet where the user loses control after typing a percent number. If percent numbers are hard to manage, simply do not allow entering percent values.

Immature Vaadin components and obscure bugs.,\"Current open forum posts ( in no particular order ): 1.  how to find out if my project needs add-on updates 2.  Tooltips on mobile devices - in our case, they block UI elements and sometimes are a pain to make go away ( I have 3 posts on this in the Vaadin Forum, for 3 different topics, and one under Stackoverflow ).  Just normal website based on dashboard demo. 3.  Playing audio ( or video ) on mobile devices tends to be tricky.  Just normal website based on dashboard demo.  Tooltips are the main show stoppers above, second being the audio playback on mobile devices ( we want to play one sound for \"\"good\"\" and another for \"\"bad\"\", which works on the desktop, just not the mobile devices ).\",\"First of all, I really enjoy working with Vaadin.  Sounds stupid, but make tooltips more generically mobile friendly.  I had to totally disable all error tooltips ( red exclamation mark with message ) on mobile devices just so users could do stuff in our website on small screens.  Maybe add a close \"\"x\"\" to right corner, like other frameworks do?  Also, unless you are already doing this, make UI components that are more mobile friendly.  For instance, drop downs can be interesting on iPhone.  Components for common data types would be nice as well ( phone number, email, number, decimal, etc ).  There are add-ons for some of this, and definitely ways to \"\"fake it\"\" in both Vaadin  and Vaadin 8, but there are some data types that are REALLY common.  Finally, I am actually holding off on moving to Vaadin 8 because, while you guys have a handy conversion tool, my application has LOTS of tables and complex forms with Vaadin style binding.  As such, even with the excellent help of your migration tool, there are 100s of lines ( at least ) that will need to be changed manually.  The compatibility mode makes this migration a little less scary, but it is still a lot of work for an application that is live and we are actively trying to sell to customers ( meaning we are always in the midst of adding new features ).  I know this is easier said then done, but an even easier migration path would be quite nice.  Yes, I know this is much harder then it sounds.  To be honest, I don't even fully think anything better can be done on your end, but I would be lying if I did not mention this as a reason I am holding off from moving to Vaadin 8.\"
